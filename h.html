    <p>Roses are often grown as ornamental plants for their beautiful and sometimes fragrant flowers. 
        They are popular garden plants but are sometimes grown indoors and are used as cut flowers.
        Most rose species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers being native to North America and
         a few to Europe and northwest Africa.

    <p>Peace lilies are sturdy, easy to grow plants with glossy, dark green oval leaves that narrow to a point. 
        The leaves rise directly from the soil. These plants also periodically produce lightly fragrant white flowers that resemble calla lilies.
         The long-lasting, pure white flowers will turn a pale green as they age.The peace lily plant is well known for its air-purifying 
         abilities as a houseplant it's great at breaking down and neutralizing toxic gases like carbon monoxide and formaldehyde.
